### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This is my GitHub page. I recently took it upon myself to clean it up, so it is still very much a work in progress. My background is in statistics and AI/ML and I am a long time Linux user. This is my private account, so you will not find all my projects here. For professional activities, I would like to refer you to my LinkedIn page, the link is below.

div{
    width:530px; /* I changed the div size, because you a have fixed width otherwise you should use scrolling */
    border:1px red solid;
    text-align:justify;    /* You will justify to 100$ of containing div, if you want to "center" just add another div with % size and centered */

}
div span{ /* I worked with your example you may use a class */
    width:60px;
    border:1px yellow solid;
    display: inline-block; /* Inline-block */ 
    position: relative; /* relative to container div*/
}

div:before{
    content: ''; /* position for block element*/
    display: block; /* the block part for the last item*/
    width: 100%;
}

div:after {
    content: '';
    display: inline-block; /* inline-block for the first (and middle elements) */
