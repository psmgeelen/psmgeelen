### Hi there 👋

This is my GitHub page. I recently took it upon myself to clean it up, so it is still very much a work in progress. My background is in statistics and AI/ML and I am a long time Linux user. This is my private account, so you will not find all my projects here. For professional activities, I would like to refer you to my LinkedIn page, the link is below.
